Overview
========

This project, completed by Team 6 -  explores acute inflammation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using SVM and MLP. It includes Jupyter notebooks, python codefile, and PPT. The project can be run in any python notebook-supporting environment, such as Jupyter notebook , pycharm or Google Colab.

Libraries Used
==============
numpy, seaborn, matplotlib,  MLPClassifier from scikit-learn, recall_score,precision_score, f1_score, accuracy_score, classification_report, svm from sklearn,confusion_matrix,precision_score, roc_curve, auc, precision_recall_curve from sklearn.metrics , PCA from sklearn.decomposition, GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection  


Instructions
============
1. **Unzip the Folder**: Extract the contents of the ZIP archive.
2.**Import**:please import all the required packages before running the code
3. **Run python files**: AcuteInflammationSVM.py has the implementation for SVM classifier and Project_ANN.ipynb has the implementation of the MLPClassifier


Conclusion
==========
This project provides a comprehensive look at classification and prediction of urinary tract infection on the acute infalmmation dataset. The project's structure allows for further exploration and experimentation with different architectures and training parameters.
